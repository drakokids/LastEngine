The 2D Engine will play a script file, or play from inside itself.

The engine is available in the following formats:
* Delphi (Windows + Direct2D or Android + OpenGLES)
* C++ and SFML (Windows, Linux or Mac)

The Engine in 2D could be different in these 2 versions. The Delphi will have some different features in order to be used for other kind of projects, not only for games.
