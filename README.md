# LastEngine
## _The Last Game Engine_

Last Engine is not just another game engine. 

## Why Another game engine?
Just because in the market there is nothing easy to use with the most possible abstraction, with functionalityes that would allow to go beyond making games.

## Why C++?
After many trials and so many options, this is an attempt to create a very fast engine future proof.
It will be funny to create a game engine from the beggining.
Using C++ we can use existing game libraries and focus in the main functionalities.

## Why use two frameworks instead of only one?
The game will have 2D and 3D modes, and the 3D mode will be mostly ortographic.
For the 2D I decided to go for low level operations in order to have no limitations. It will be a slow process.
I will test BGFX in the first place because of the working platforms.
For the 3D, I want to have a running version very quickly, so a working rendering technology would be the best option.
I choosed OgreNext because of the rendering capabilities and the documentation.

## What applications can I use with it?
- 2D Games and 3D Games.
- Multimedia Presentations.
- Simulations.
- Projections with multiple projectors and world transformations.

## What platforms will it support?
Windows and MacOS for development platform.
The engine will compile in for windows, Mac, Linux, Android and Web.
