# LastEngine
## _The Last Game Engine in Pascal_

Last Engine is not just another game engine. 

## Why Another game engine?
Just because in the market there is nothing easy to use with the most possible abstraction, with functionalityes that would allow to go beyond making games.

## Why Pascal?
Pascal was my second language, right after assembly, and for many years I have been using Delphi or Lazarus to build applications that could be in the market the fast way possible. So, to make a game engine very fast, what else could I use?
Probably would not be the best language for a top game engine, but I do not want the fastest game engine, but simply a game engine I could use for my own projects.

## What applications can I use with it?
- 2D Games and 3D Games.
- Multimedia Presentations.
- Simulations.
- Projections with multiple projectors and world transformations.

## What platforms will it support?
Windows and Linux as primary platform OS.
The engine will compile in Delphi or Lazarus for windows, and in Lazarus for Linux.
Android could also be used in future but with reduced capabilities.

## Main Functionalities
- Latest OpenGL 3D and 2D.
- Large Maps for 2D and 3D.
- Fake 3D mode, using only 2D.
- 2D drawing functions ( Lines, Rectangles, Circles, Triangles, Text, and many others )
- Realistic Rendering in 3D.
- Automatic Effects in 3D ( Shadows, Glows, Lights )
- 3D Sounds.
- 2D and 3D Physics
- Animations and Videos.
- Multimonitor ( up to 6 monitors ).
- Resolutions per monitor up to 4K.
- Smart Blending and Bending for projetions in shaped locals.
- Realistic Water, Ocean, Sky, Vegetation.
- Particles 2D and 3D
- Interface with Gamepads, Joysticks.
- Touch Screen support.
- Interface with Arcade joysticks, Buttons, Gun's, Spinners, and Led controllers.
- Windows Game Engine Editor with Multiple Editors ( Sprites, Tile Maps, Vector Roads, 3D world editor, Sound )
- Execution Script Language for simple demos and games
