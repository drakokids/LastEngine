# LastEngine
## _The Last Game Engine_

Last Engine is not just another game engine. 

## Why Another game engine?
Just because in the market there is nothing easy to use with the most possible abstraction, with functionalityes that would allow to go beyond making games.

## Rendering in 2D or 3D?
The Engine will have both modes, but in 2D or 2.5D modes, it will be capable of fake 3D by using ortographic projection.

## Why IDE could be used?
For the Editor it will compile in Delphi XE11 or greator.
For the Game it self, it can compile both in Delphi and Lazarus IDE.

Why Pascal? Because it will be funny to create a game engine from the beggining and Pascal is one of my old languages, where I have more experience.

If used the Editor, and the script language, it's not necessary to have any of this editors installed.

## What hardware acceleration will be available?
Most of the inside renderings will be done in OpenGL.
The 2D Mode will use either Direct2D (in windows), or OpenGL (in Linux of Android).

## What applications can I do with it?
- All Kind of 2D, 2.5D and 3D Games.
- Multimedia Presentations.
- Simulations.
- Projections with multiple projectors and world transformations.

## What platforms will it support?
Windows for development platform (Mac x86 could be used using parallels Desktop).
For all kind of projects, the engine will compile for windows, MacOs, Linux, Raspberry Pi, Android and iOS. 

It it also possible to create a game without compiling, just by adding the necessary scrits and media files.

## Suported Hardware
- Windows Computer for Development.
- GPU compatible with the rendering sdk.
- GPIO Hardware (Raspberry Pi, UpBoard)
- Digital and Analog Arcade Controllers
- Arcade Guns, Spinners & Led Controllers
- Touch Monitors
- Stereo, 5.1 & 7.1 Sound Cards
- Joysticks & Gamepads
- Mouse & Keyboards
- WebCameras

## Main Functionalities
